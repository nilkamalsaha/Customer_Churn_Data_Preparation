# Customer_Churn_Data_Preparation
You’ve just been hired as a Jr. Data Scientist for Maven Music, a streaming service that’s been losing more customers than usual the past few months and would like to use data science to figure out how to reduce customer churn

Hi again,

Thanks for scoping the customer churn project with us earlier. We’ve identified the location of the data sets for the project that we talked about – customer and listening history. Can you read the data into Python, clean it, explore it and prepare it for modeling? More details can be found in the attached Jupyter Notebook.

Thanks for all your help!

Carter

## Key Objectives

1. Revisit the project scope
2. Read the data files into Python
3. Clean the data by converting data types, resolving data issues, and creating new columns
4. Explore the data independently, then join the tables for further exploration
5. Create a non-null, numeric DataFrame and engineer features that could be good predictors of customer churn
6. Visualize and interpret the data in the final DataFrame that is ready for modeling
